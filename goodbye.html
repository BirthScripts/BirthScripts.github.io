  <p>Hey everyone. I just wanted to let you know that I've made a decision to step back from Discord for a little while. I've been thinking a lot about my priorities and I really need to focus on my studies and personal growth right now. It's not an easy decision, but I think it's what's best for me at this point. Also, I want to take a moment to apologize to Averyy. I messed up and accidentally shared some of her pictures and other stuff, and I feel terrible about it. Averyy, if you're reading this, I'm truly sorry. I didn't mean to cause any harm or discomfort.</p>
